- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sbwcuae
The Sharjah Business Women Council was brought to life over in 2002 
as a way to support the integration of women into the global economy, 
under the Amiri Decree No.8. Eight years later in December 2010 SBWC was delighted to be granted legal personality and capacity 
to operate under the prestigious umbrella of the Executive Office of Her Highness Sheikha Jawaher Bint Mohammed Al Qasimi, 
Wife of the Ruler of Sharjah, Chairperson of Nama Women Advancement Establishment, Founder and Patron of Sharjah Business Women Council.
